# SQL Murder Mystery Project

## Overview
Welcome to my SQL Murder Mystery project! This project is a demonstration of my SQL skills and problem-solving abilities, using a fun and interactive murder mystery scenario.

## Project Description
The SQL Murder Mystery is an engaging puzzle that allows users to employ SQL to investigate a fictional crime. The database contains various tables, including crime reports, witness statements, and suspect profiles. My mission was to formulate SQL queries to uncover critical information, connect the dots, and eventually solve the mystery!

## How to Use
To experience the mystery yourself, you can download the SQL Murder Mystery database from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) or play it in-browser at [https://mystery.knightlab.com/](https://mystery.knightlab.com/). 

To view my solution, simply open the `solution.sqbpro` file and scroll to the bottom. But what fun is that?

## Technologies Used
- SQLite: The SQL database that stores all the data for the mystery.
- DB Browser for SQLite: Used to interact with the SQLite database and write queries.
